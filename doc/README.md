# IMPORTANT

* This is not ready for public disclosure

* WIP: It can but it's not supposed to work in the current state

* I tend to cut the problems into small pieces, easier to handle. This may seem too much, and sometimes it is.  
  Once it's working, it's easier to see what are the real functional frontiers and how to refactor at best, rejoin modules or not.  
  In the mean time, it makes it easier to work in // on the project, since there are less collisions.
  
* Some things may be overcomplicated, and POC will tell what can be simplified.

* Some things are tagged TODO: but can be left over for a Minimal Viable Product.
